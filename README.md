### Overview of the school district analysis
This analysis tries to show the relationship between budget cost, size of students in a school/charter/district and the their academic performances. During such analysis, variables were adjusted which brought about a drastic change in its outcome, as *Thomas High School*  had its *9th graders* excluded from the data. Such a reduced brough about a positive reflection of student's overall performance in the *math & reading*.

### Result
- The district is performing poorly in iths performance with an overall of 64.9%
- Hugh budgets are given to poorly performed schools i.e. *Bailey High School*, *Hernandez High School*, *Johnson High School*.
- The overall performance of *Thomas High School* was relatively high after replacing the nineth graders from *65.1 to 90.6%*
- By replacing the nine graders: Math & Reading scores had a high positive result, scores by school ranges changed which means more spending, scores by school size shows less peformance in schools with more number of student i.e. less teacher's attention to students growth, and scores by type shows districts is doing poorly compared to the charter

### Summary
The replacement of the nineth grade improved the per capita budget for Thomas High school, showed a better academic performmance of the school, it contributed to the overall performance of charter and, such performance encourages for an adjusted budget planning per head.
