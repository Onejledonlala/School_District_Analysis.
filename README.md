### Overview of the school district analysis
This analysis tries to show the relationship between budget cost, size of students in a school/charter/district and the their academic performances. During such analysis, variables were adjusted which brought about a drastic change in its outcome, as *Thomas High School*  had its *9th graders* excluded from the data. Such a reduced brough about a positive reflection of student's overall performance in the *math & reading*.

### Result
- The district performed poorly overall compared to the charter
